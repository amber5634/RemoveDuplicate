# RemoveDuplicate
In this program I am using Set. If you know about Collection, Set, HashSet then one thing which you will know about Set is that it can not 
contain duplicate elements. Set however don't have it's own method. That is why in order to create an object of Set we need to use HashSet
as HashSet implements Set(which means it is inherited by HashSet).
To do so we use Set<> set=new HashSet
Here we taking Integer values only so Set<Integer> set=new HashSet<Integer>();
The elements are added in the Set with the help of Set object and if duplicate elements are added it will return false which means the element will not be added to the Set. 
You can look into the code to understand better and implement in your system to get better grasp of Set Collection in java.
